Looking on the webpage:
Search engine optimization button doesnt work
text misalign when close the browser to much (buttons on top and text on bottom)
the whole side panel (benefits) jumps down when window is squezed together tomuch, not sure if there are any better alternatives

Looking at the css file:
Not sure about *a
why is the the main img in the file in css and not html
